 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-MIT-blue)

 
## Introduction
   
This application was originally !{[](https://github.com/AnthonyBuffill/invoicinator) designed by a team. I took it and made it with react. Made it into a fully Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed for managing invoices with a seamless, offline-capable experience. It allows users to create, store, and manage invoices, and also provides functionality to send them via email.

Key Features
Invoice Creation: Users can easily create detailed invoices using a user-friendly interface. The application supports various fields such as client information, itemized details, and pricing.

Offline Functionality: As a PWA, the application offers robust offline support. Users can create and manage invoices even without an active internet connection. All data is stored locally and synchronized with the server once the connection is restored.

Data Storage: Invoices are stored in IndexedDB, ensuring that user data is preserved and accessible even when offline. The application efficiently manages and retrieves stored data for quick access.

Email Integration: Users can send invoices directly via email from within the app. The application integrates with email services to facilitate easy and quick delivery of invoices to clients.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Service Worker Support: The app utilizes service workers to provide fast loading times, reliable offline capabilities, and background sync for uploading data when connectivity is available.

User Authentication: Includes secure user authentication for managing individual accounts and ensuring that invoice data is private and secure.
